========

The intended directory structure for a project is as follows:

"projectname"/main/src - contains java source code for the main program

"projectname"/main/resources - contains java specific configuration/resources for the main program

"projectname"/test/src - contains java source code for unit tests

"projectname"/test/resources - contains java specific configuration/resources for unit tests
